### Test with Users

In general, we want to validate that our Code for Denver projects are delivering value, per CfD's stated values [https://github.com/codefordenver/projects/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md]. We want to avoid creating technology only for technology's sake or _just_ the cool factor.

Before moving into the "Active Development" phase, a project should validate its value by testing with prospective users. Based on this feedback, the project may decide to make adjustments or forge ahead.

Since this is the exploration phase, a prototype may be a technical POC, wireframes, or a paper prototype.

Ideally, test users would be from the targetted community partners (folks from designated non-profits, government agencies, etc).

Things to validate:
# project purpose - are we fulfilling a need in the community?
# user experience / usability - have we optimized how the user interacts with the project?
# technology choices - does the anticipated technical direction lend itself to solving our users' problems?
